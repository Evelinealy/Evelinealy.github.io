# Sign-Up Form

This project is a signup form written purely in HTML and CSS. There were no libraries used. However, that may change in the future.

The design idea was taken from The Odin Project, however, all code was written completely from scratch by me.

This sign-up form is FAKE and is only used for showcasing my HTML/CSS skills. The signup form can be adjusted and is relatively responsive with some few exceptions to small and unimportant texts. These execeptions are only apparent when the browser is shrunk to an unreadably-small size and does not have any effect when used in standard browser sizes.

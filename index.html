            Hi there! My name is Aly. I am a full-stack developer in California.
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Ever since I was a kid I enjoyed programming, especially when I used
            to play games like Minecraft and found out how to modify it to my
            pleasure.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I started taking programming seriously in my freshman year of High
            School when I signed up for my first Introduction to Computer
            Science, which happened to be a college course. It was the first
            time I really learned about the concept and truly loved it. After that, I
            went to a summer camp for coding hosted at Stanford College and
            created my very first game written fully in Java.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thanks to the fun experiences in both my childhood and summer camp
            experiences, I decided to pursue my Bachelor's Degree in Computer
            Science. From my time studying in college, I decided that being a
            full-stack developer would be my goal in starting my career. Since
            then, I have been polishing my skills in Javascript and have made
            some very fun projects. I have discovered too, that I love designing
            and creating websites, so I have been refining my HTML and CSS
            knowledge as well.

              <p>This is an application made in IntelliJ using Java, JavaFX, and SceneBuilder. It allows the user to schedule, remove, and add appointments they have with customers.</p>
              <br>
              <p>This project took me some time to make. Whenever I would get stuck, I would use documents, my peers, google, and other resources to get help. Because of this, I was able to create a working schedule management application. Because I have made the project private on Github, I am sharing a read-only view of the project in Gitfront. A video demo of the project is displayed in the README file.</p>

              <h2>Description</h2>
              <p>C++ was a very difficult for me to learn because it was very different from the works of Java or Javascript--languages that I was used to. I tried applying my skills by making a class roster from a prexisting list. This list displays my abilities to manipulate and parse data. Because this is mostly backend, I have yet to display this on a live website; however, an exe file is included in the Github for live viewing purposes. Because I have made the project private on Github, I am sharing a read-only view of the project in Gitfront. All code are located within the file.</p>

              <p>This project scenario was designed from an idea from my school. The goal for this application is to locate each package's desired destination and come up with the fastest route for it to be delivered. Once it has been delivered, it will indicate it by showing a "delivered" status. The user can enter any date they would like to check a package's status.</p>

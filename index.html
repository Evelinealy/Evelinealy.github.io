            Hi there! My name is Aly. I am a full-stack developer in California.
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Ever since I was a kid I enjoyed programming, especially when I used
            to play games like Minecraft and found out how to modify it to my
            pleasure.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I started taking programming seriously in my freshman year of High
            School when I signed up for my first Introduction to Computer
            Science, which happened to be a college course. It was the first
            time I really learned about the concept and truly loved it. After that, I
            went to a summer camp for coding hosted at Stanford College and
            created my very first game written fully in Java.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thanks to the fun experiences in both my childhood and summer camp
            experiences, I decided to pursue my Bachelor's Degree in Computer
            Science. From my time studying in college, I decided that being a
            full-stack developer would be my goal in starting my career. My long-term goal is to go into Cyber Security and use my skills of making web appliacations to web application security. Since then, I have been polishing my skills in Javascript and Node.JS outside of school times and have made some very fun projects. I have discovered too, that I love designing and creating websites, so I have been refining my HTML and CSS
            knowledge as well.

              <p>This is an application made in IntelliJ using Java, JavaFX, and SceneBuilder. It allows the user to schedule, remove, and add appointments they have with customers.</p>
              <br>
              <p>This project took me some time to make. Whenever I would get stuck, I would use documents, my peers, google, and other resources to get help. Because of this, I was able to create a working schedule management application. Because I have made the project private on Github, I am sharing a read-only view of the project in Gitfront. A video demo of the project is displayed in the README file.</p>

              <p>C++ was a very difficult for me to learn because it was very different from the works of Java or Javascript--languages that I was used to. I tried applying my skills by making a class roster from a prexisting list. This list displays my abilities to manipulate and parse data. Because this is mostly backend, I have yet to display this on a live website; however, an exe file is included in the Github for live viewing purposes. Because I have made the project private on Github, I am sharing a read-only view of the project in Gitfront. All code are located within the file.</p>

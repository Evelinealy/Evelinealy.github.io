## Evelinealy's Portfolio

This github repository holds my portfolio, the programs I have created, and how to get in touch! This site was created with vanilla Javascript, CSS, and HTML. It was also taken from inspiration from multiple places, but the main sources are the follow:

Alimi Moussad's Website: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/crypticacoder/e/55726

and

Online Tutorial's CSS videos: https://www.youtube.com/@OnlineTutorialsYT
